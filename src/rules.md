# About the Commissions


1. I do NOT draw gore or extreme explicit content, 
    I'm ok with nudity or soft suggestive content, 
    but I'm not and NSFW artist

2. I am not a furry artist, so I will need to see first
    the character in question to see if I could do a 
    proper job with them. (example in Work examples)

What you can do with them: 

1. Use them as your profile picture or banner in your
    social media (adding credit). 

2. Print or using the drawing for non economical 
    purpose (ex:/ making your own poster).

PLEASE, do not resell them in anyway, 
or declare that it's yours, I would like to 
have the credits of the artwork.
